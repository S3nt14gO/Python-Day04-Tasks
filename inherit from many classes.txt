can a class inherit from multiple classes python

yes python allow inheritance from many classes

as Example
#####
class Mammal:
    def mammal_info(self):
        print("Mammals can give direct birth.")

class WingedAnimal:
    def winged_animal_info(self):
        print("Winged animals can flap.")

class Bat(Mammal, WingedAnimal):
    pass

# create an object of Bat class
b1 = Bat()

b1.mammal_info()
b1.winged_animal_info()
####
then the output must be
###
Mammals can give direct birth.
Winged animals can flap.
