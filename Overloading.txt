python support overloading method?

no python does not support overloading

The problem with method overloading in Python is that we
may overload the methods but can only use the latest defined method.


for exapmle
####
def product(a, b):
    p = a * b
    print(p)

def product(a, b, c):
    p = a * b*c
    print(p)

product(4, 5, 5)

###
the output will be 100

1st function will be overidded by the 2nd function
